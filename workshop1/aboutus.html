        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Our coffee shop was founded in 1995 by John Smith, a coffee lover and entrepreneur. John had a passion for coffee and he wanted to create a place where people could come together to enjoy a good cup of coffee and relax.</p>
        <p>Over the years, our coffee shop has become a popular destination for coffee lovers from all over the world. We are known for our high-quality coffee, cozy atmosphere, and friendly staff.</p>
        <p>We source our coffee beans from small, independent farmers who use sustainable and ethical farming practices. We believe in supporting local communities and we are committed to reducing our environmental impact.</p>
